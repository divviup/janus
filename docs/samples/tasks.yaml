  # The DAP task ID is provided in base64url-encoded form, much like in request
  # paths. IDs are 32 bytes long, and they should be randomly generated, per
  # DAP's recommendation.

  # The DAP role of this Janus instance in this task. Either "Leader" or

  # The task's end time, as a number of seconds after the Unix epoch.

  # interval queries.
